# Ansible Simple Web Interface

A lightweight, Docker-based web interface for managing and executing Ansible playbooks. Run playbooks with a single click, monitor execution status in real-time, and view logs through a clean, modern web UI.

## Features

### Core Features
- **One-Click Execution** - Run any playbook with a single button click
- **Multi-Host Support** - Target individual hosts or groups via dropdown selection
- **Real-Time Status** - Live status updates (Ready/Running/Completed/Failed)
- **Log Management** - Automatic log capture with timestamped filenames
- **Log Viewer** - Browse and view all execution logs in the browser
- **Theming Support** - Multiple themes including dark mode, low contrast, and colorblind-friendly options
- **REST API** - JSON endpoints for external integrations
- **Fully Containerized** - Rocky Linux 9 with Ansible 8.7.0 pre-configured
- **Localhost First** - Secure by default, ready for authentication later
- **Flexible Storage** - Choose between flat file (JSON) or MongoDB for data persistence
- **Inventory Management** - API for managing host inventory with full CRUD operations

### Batch Job Execution
- **Batch Jobs** - Select multiple playbooks and hosts, run them sequentially as a named batch
- **Playbook Ordering** - Drag-and-drop or up/down buttons to reorder playbook execution
- **Live Batch Monitoring** - Watch batch progress with automatic log switching between playbooks
- **Real-time Log Streaming** - Worker logs stream live to batch view with late-join catchup
- **Export Configurations** - Export batch job configs as JSON for version control
- **Batch Scheduling** - Schedule batch jobs with full recurrence options

### Schedule Management
- **Playbook Scheduling** - Schedule single playbooks or batch jobs with cron-like recurrence
- **Success Rate Tracking** - Track success/failure rates per schedule (e.g., "8/10 succeeded")
- **Execution History** - View detailed history of scheduled runs

### Host Configuration Wizard
- **Multi-Step Wizard** - Guided 4-step process for adding/editing hosts
- **SSH Key Management** - Upload and manage SSH private keys securely
- **Multiple Auth Methods** - Support for SSH keys, passwords, or SSH agent
- **Connection Testing** - Test SSH connectivity before saving host configuration

### AI Agent (Log Review & Assistance)
- **Automatic Log Review** - AI analyzes playbook output after each run
- **Structured Analysis** - Summary, status, issues (error/warning/info), suggestions
- **Suggested Fix** - SSH auth failures show step-by-step fix with public key and Copy button
- **Agent Dashboard** - Recent reviews, proposals, config reports

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- docker-compose
- SSH server on target hosts

### 1. Start the Container

```bash
# Clone or navigate to project directory
cd ansible-simpleweb

# Build and start (full stack: web + optional MongoDB, agent, workers)
docker-compose up -d

# Verify it's running
docker-compose ps
```

**Single image / demo:** To run only the primary container (no DB, agent, or workers), build the image and use the single-container compose file. See **Single-container (demo) mode** in `docs/REBUILD.md` and the **Single-container and expansion workflow** there for initial config, bootstrap, and adding workers later. For **new install**, **restore from backup**, and **disaster recovery**, see **`docs/INSTALL.md`**.

### 2. Access the Web Interface

Open your browser to: **http://localhost:3001**

You'll see all available playbooks with run buttons and status indicators.

### 3. Run Your First Playbook

1. Select a target from the dropdown (e.g., "host_machine")
2. Click "Run Playbook"
3. Watch the status change to "Running"
4. Click "View Log" when complete

Done.

## Adding Playbooks

Simply drop a `.yml` file in the `playbooks/` directory:

```bash
# Create a new playbook
cat > playbooks/my-playbook.yml << 'EOF'
---
- name: My Custom Playbook
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Collect information
      debug:
        msg: "Running on {{ ansible_hostname }}"
EOF

# Refresh the web interface - it appears automatically!
```

**That's it!** No restart needed, no configuration required.

## Adding Hosts

Edit `inventory/hosts` to add new target machines:

```ini
[production]
prod1.example.com ansible_user=deploy
prod2.example.com ansible_user=deploy

[staging]
stage.example.com ansible_user=deploy
```

Refresh the page - new hosts appear in the dropdown automatically.

## Documentation

- **[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Single reference: components, workflows, logs and debugging (including agent)
- **Agent (LLM)**: Ollama runs **only in the `ollama` container** (do not run Ollama on the host). Default model is `qwen2.5-coder:3b`; use `1.5b` for lightest, `7b` for best quality. Change via `LLM_MODEL` in agent-service env. Pull: `docker compose exec -T ollama ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:3b`. Verify: `./scripts/verify-ollama.sh`. Logs: `docker compose logs ollama`.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Start the service
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart after changes
docker-compose restart

# Stop the service
docker-compose down

# Run playbook manually (from host)
docker-compose exec -T ansible-web ansible-playbook playbooks/your-playbook.yml -l target
```

## Requirements

- Docker Engine 20.10+
- docker-compose 1.29+
- 2GB RAM minimum
- Network access to target hosts

## Security Notes

- Currently **localhost only** (no external access)
- No authentication required (add before exposing externally)
- SSH keys mounted read-only from `~/.ssh`
- Service account recommended for target hosts (see [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md))

## Cluster Mode (NEW)

Distribute Ansible workloads across multiple worker nodes for scalability and fault tolerance.

### Cluster Features
- **Worker Registration** - Workers auto-register with primary server using tokens
- **Worker Dashboard** - Real-time view of all workers with health stats
- **Smart Job Routing** - Automatic job assignment based on tags, load, and preferences
- **Content Sync** - Playbooks/inventory sync from primary to workers with revision tracking
- **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket notifications for sync events
- **Tag-Based Targeting** - Route jobs to specific workers via required/preferred tags
- **Health Monitoring** - Worker check-ins with CPU, memory, and disk stats
- **Local Executor Fallback** - Built-in local worker as lowest-priority fallback

### Quick Cluster Setup

```bash
# Start cluster with 3 workers
docker-compose up -d

# Verify workers registered
curl http://localhost:3001/api/workers | python3 -m json.tool
```
