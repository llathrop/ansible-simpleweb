[DEPRECATION WARNING]: DEFAULT_GATHER_TIMEOUT option, the module_defaults 
keyword is a more generic version and can apply to all calls to the 
M(ansible.builtin.gather_facts) or M(ansible.builtin.setup) actions, use 
module_defaults instead. This feature will be removed from ansible-core in 
version 2.18. Deprecation warnings can be disabled by setting 
deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.
ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  mapping values are not allowed in this context

The error appears to be in '/app/playbooks/network-config.yml': line 7, column 39, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    - name: Get network interfaces from ip command
      shell: ip -o link show | awk -F': ' '{print $2}' | grep -v '^lo$'
                                      ^ here
